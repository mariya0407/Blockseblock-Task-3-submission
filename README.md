# NYC Taxi Trip Duration ‚Äì Exploratory Data Analysis

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the **New York City Taxi Trip Duration** dataset from Kaggle.  
We use Python (pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to visualize and analyze the trips.

---

## üìÑ Dataset Description

The dataset contains more than **1.45 million taxi trips** collected in New York City.  
Each record includes:

- `id`: Unique identifier for each trip  
- `vendor_id`: Taxi company identifier (1 or 2)  
- `pickup_datetime` & `dropoff_datetime`: Timestamps of the trip  
- `passenger_count`: Number of passengers  
- `pickup_longitude`, `pickup_latitude`: Pickup coordinates  
- `dropoff_longitude`, `dropoff_latitude`: Drop-off coordinates  
- `store_and_fwd_flag`: Whether the trip record was stored before being sent  
- `trip_duration`: Duration of the trip in seconds  

We also derived additional columns such as **pickup hour**, **pickup day of week**, and **trip distance (km)** for deeper insights.

## üìù Insights & Observations

- **Ride Volume Over Time**: The number of trips varies by day, with noticeable dips on some holidays/weekends.  
- **Peak Hours**: Most pickups occur during **morning rush (7‚Äì9 AM)** and **evening rush (5‚Äì8 PM)**.  
- **Trip Duration Distribution**: The majority of trips last under 20 minutes; a long tail indicates a small number of very long trips.  
- **Distance vs Duration**: Strong positive relationship for normal trips; outliers may represent traffic congestion or unusual routes.  
- **Passenger Count**: Most rides have 1 passenger; median trip duration does not change much for higher counts.  
- **Spatial Patterns**: Pickup scatterplot shows dense clusters in Manhattan, JFK, and LaGuardia areas.  
- **Correlations**: Trip distance correlates moderately with trip duration; passenger count shows little correlation.  
- **Heatmap by Day & Hour**: Trips tend to last longer during **rush hours** across all weekdays.
