# NYC Taxi Trip Duration — EDA & Visualizations

This repository contains Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) code and visualizations for the **NYC Taxi Trip Duration** dataset (Kaggle). The visualizations show temporal patterns, distributions, spatial clusters, and relationships between trip features.

> **Note:** This repo does not include the original Kaggle dataset. Download the dataset from Kaggle (e.g. `train.csv`) and place it in the `data/` folder or specify the path when running the script.
